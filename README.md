# SQL TO DO LIST

## Description

<!-- Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it? -->

Creating a to-do list web application using the full stack.

## Installation

1. Create a database named `weekend-to-do-app`
2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries,
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`

## Usage

A user will enter their task and hit **Add Task**. This will add their task to the to-do list database and update the webpage. The tasks appear on the webpage as a list. A user may click **Mark Complete** when a task has been completed and the list item will be crossed out or they may click **Delete** and the list item will be removed from the database and webpage.
